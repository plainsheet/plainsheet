# Welcome! ‚õ¥Ô∏è

Thank you for being interested in the project!  
**We welcome every contribution, from anyone.**  
Feel free to reach out to use at [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/pGzJgKKj) üôåüèª

### How We Work

We have [a project board](https://github.com/orgs/plainsheet/projects/2), which we keep our backlogs and tasks in progress.  
Feel free to pick one and assign yourself to the item, and make a feature branch.  
From there, you can start to develop the feature, and make a PR to the main branch.

If you want to co-author with other collaborators, consider using [coauthors](https://github.com/coauthors/coauthors)! it's a handy tool to add a co-author to your commits.

### Setting Up The Repository üíª

2. Run `nvm use`
3. Run `pnpm install`
4. Run `pnpm run dev --filter {workspace that you develop}`
